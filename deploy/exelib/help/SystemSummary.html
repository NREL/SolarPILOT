<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The Hermite (analytical) option on the Performance Simulation page produces results exemplified by the following table:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem233.png"></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The values associated with each of the seventeen metrics are displayed in five columns. The columns are defined as follows:</span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: decimal;">
<li value="1" class="rvps2"><span class="rvts29">Value</span><span class="rvts6">: The reported value is the nominal, field-wide, value that represents the best summary of the simulated system. For efficiency values, the nominal value may differ from a pure statistical average, and both are reported. In cases where the mean and nominal efficiency values are equal by definition, the mean value is not reported separately.</span></li>
<li value="2" class="rvps2"><span class="rvts29">Mean</span><span class="rvts6">: The arithmetic mean across the entire sample (either all heliostats, or all flux locations).</span></li>
<li value="3" class="rvps2"><span class="rvts29">Minimum</span><span class="rvts6">: The minimum value observed across the entire sample.</span></li>

<li value="5" class="rvps2"><span class="rvts29">Std. dev</span><span class="rvts6">: The standard deviation of the values observed across the entire sample.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The metrics are calculated according to the conventions described below. Note that the order of efficiency values corresponds to the order in which they are calculated by SolarPILOT. Each efficiency term is defined such that it represents the loss incurred after all previous losses are imposed.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Total plant cost ($)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The total plant cost is calculated on the Costs page and reported on the Simulation Results page. Please refer to the </span><a class="rvts20" href="Costs.html#Page%20Overview">Costs page documentation</a><span class="rvts6"> for details on the calculation method.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Simulated heliostat area (m^2)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This value is the total aperture area of all heliostats that are enabled and included in the layout for the most recent performance simulation. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Simulated heliostat count (-)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This value is the number of heliostats that are enabled and included in the layout for the most recent performance simulation. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Power incident on field (kW)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This value is the product of the Direct Normal Irradiation on the Performance Simulation page and the Simulated heliostat area as reported on the System Summary page.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>

<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This value is the power that is absorbed by the receiver absorber material </span><span class="rvts28">after</span><span class="rvts6"> reflection losses but </span><span class="rvts28">before</span><span class="rvts41"> </span><span class="rvts6">thermal losses including convective, radiative, and piping losses are accounted for. The value is the product of Power incident on the field and Optical efficiency including receiver (defined below).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Power absorbed by HTF (kW)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This value is the power that is absorbed by the heat transfer fluid after all optical and thermal losses (including convective, radiative, and piping losses) are accounted for.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Cloudiness efficiency (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Cloudiness efficiency is non-unity when the Simulate cloud transient option is enabled on the Performance Simulation page. Simulated clouds reduce the irradiance incident on affected heliostats, and the cloudiness efficiency represents the percentage of power that passes through the clouds and strikes the heliostats. The efficiency value accounts for potential differences in individual heliostat aperture area.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Shading efficiency (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Shading efficiency represents the proportion of power lost due to heliostats casting shadows on neighbors, thereby preventing irradiance from reaching a portion of the affected heliostat(s). </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">SolarPILOT calculates shadowing and blocking using a vector projection and clipping method. Neighboring heliostats are tested for potential interference by projecting vectors from the heliostat corners along the direction of either the tower (blocking) or sun position (shadowing). If a projected vector intercepts an adjacent heliostat, blocking or shadowing are enforced according to the position of the interception. This method assumes that neighboring heliostats lie in parallel planes, which holds for all but very small solar fields in which tracking angles differ significantly between neighboring heliostats. This assumption results in the simplification that shadowed or blocked regions are rectangular, which simplifies the computation without affecting accuracy. Overlap of shadowing and blocking is neglected, so the blocking-shadowing efficiency is conservative.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The shadowing and blocking algorithm is as follows:</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<ol style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: decimal;">
<li value="1" class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Each heliostat </span><span class="rvts29">J</span><span class="rvts6"> is assigned a list of neighbors that may block or shadow ("interfere'" with) the heliostat. An interfering heliostat is subsequently denoted </span><span class="rvts29">K</span><span class="rvts6">.</span></li>
<li value="2" class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">A vector aiming at the </span><span class="rvts28">subject</span><span class="rvts6"> is calculated for the interfering heliostat </span><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem229.png"><span class="rvts6">. The </span><span class="rvts28">subject</span><span class="rvts6"> is either the receiver (blocking scenario) or the sun (shadowing scenario). </span></li>

<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The first test requires that the interfering heliostat </span><span class="rvts29">K</span><span class="rvts6"> is within view of the interfered heliostat </span><span class="rvts29">J</span><span class="rvts6">.

This limit is conservative, as blocking and shadowing losses converge for radial-stagger layouts at approximately 20 x </span><span class="rvts28">h</span><span class="rvts61">J</span><span class="rvts6"> for elevation angles as low as three degrees.</span></li>

<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Cosine efficiency (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Cosine efficiency is calculated by taking the ratio of power incident on the aperture area of the heliostat field divided by the available power after cloudiness and shadowing losses. Cosine loss is evaluated for each heliostat by taking the dot product of the heliostat normal vector and the sun vector.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Reflection efficiency (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Reflection efficiency captures power loss after cloudiness, shadowing, and cosine efficiency, and includes both mirror soiling and reflectivity efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Blocking efficiency (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Blocking efficiency accounts for power loss due to light that is reflected from heliostats onto the back of adjacent heliostats. Blocking is calculated according to the algorithm described in the Shading efficiency section above. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Attenuation efficiency (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Attenuation efficiency accounts for power loss during transmission of reflected light from the heliostats in the field to the receiver. Attenuation is caused by atmospheric scattering of light, in which light interacts with water vapor, dust, or other particulate matter and is reflected, refracted, or absorbed. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Image intercept efficiency (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Image intercept efficiency accounts for light that is transmitted from the heliostat field to the position of the receiver but fails to intercept or impinge on the receiver aperture. This loss is also referred to as "spillage." Light that strikes non-absorbing surfaces such as oven boxes, refractory walls, or the tower structure, or light that misses the receiver system entirely is accounted for in this efficiency value. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">SolarPILOT calculates intercept efficiency for each heliostat by taking the integral of the flux image function (the Hermite polynomial model) using Guassian quadrature. The intercept efficiency accounts for the user-selected heliostat aim point strategy.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Absorption efficiency (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Absorption efficiency accounts for losses due to light reflecting off of the surface of the receiver. Normally, this value is equal to the receiver surface absorptivity that you specify on the Receiver page(s).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Solar field optical efficiency (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This value represents the total optical efficiency of the solar field </span><span class="rvts28">excluding receiver absorption efficiency</span><span class="rvts6">. The solar field optical efficiency is equal to the product of all efficiency values except absorption efficiency.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Optical efficiency incl. receiver (%)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This value represents the total optical efficiency of the solar field and receiver. The optical efficiency including receiver is equal to the product of all efficiency values.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<h3 class="rvps12"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts24">Incident flux (kW/m2)</span></span></h3>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The Incident flux indicates the intensity of reflected irradiation that is incident on the receiver after all losses, including receiver absorption efficiency. The number reported in the </span><span class="rvts28">Value</span><span class="rvts6"> column indicates the mean flux intensity across the receiver aperture.</span></p>
